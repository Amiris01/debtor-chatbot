        Secured debt is backed by collateral, such as a house or a car, meaning the lender can take the asset if you fail to repay. Unsecured debt, on the other hand, is not tied to any specific asset, which means the lender cannot claim specific property if you default. Examples of unsecured debt include credit card debt and medical bills.

  utter_ask_legal_rights:

        As a debtor, you have several legal rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). These include:
        - The right to be treated fairly and without harassment by debt collectors.
        - The right to request verification of your debt, including details on the amount and the original creditor.
        - The right to dispute a debt and seek validation if you believe it is not yours.
        - The right to limit communication from debt collectors, including requesting that they cease contact.
        - Protection against abusive, deceptive, or unfair practices during the collection process.
        If you feel your rights are being violated, you may file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or consult a legal professional.
